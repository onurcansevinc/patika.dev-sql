2. **Download dvdrental Sample Database:**
   Get the `.tar` file from [dvdrental Download Page](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip)

3. **Restore the Database:**
   Open terminal and run:

    ```bash
    pg_restore -U your_username -d dvdrental -v "/path/to/dvdrental.tar"
    ```

4. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onurcansevinc/patika.dev-sql.git
```
